                        Competitive pressures, reduced time-to-market, increased demands of
                        customers, and globalization are
                        driving global product companies to explore the offshore route. A
                        reliable offshore partner can play
                        a key role from concept to the launch of the product. Product companies
                        have increased their
                        competitive advantage by partnering with offshore players for product
                        development.

                          encompassing all the PDLC stages. Our agile software project is capable

                        Arkedge has a well-defined and mature application development service

                        Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), beginning with transforming business
                        requirements into project functional requirements, development, quality,
                        testing, implementation, training and application support. Our distributed
                        delivery methodology effectively leverages the onsite subject matter
                        expertise and the offshore development teams, resulting in cost-effective
                        solutions. Each of the development phases can be defined with metrics and
                        subsequently tracked with the monitoring tools and well defined project
                        management and execution processes.

                      Arkedge provides outsourced software development services for in-house
                      applications, across the project lifecycle. We partner with you from
                      internal proposals and budgeting, through project approvals, all the way to
                      delivery, training, maintenance and support. Our flexible offshore software
                      development model allows companies to maximize their ROI, while maintaining
                      complete control over projects.

                      <br>

                      At each stage of the application development cycle we bring people, process
                      and technology expertise to pro-actively guide you through the challenges of
                      meeting application requirements within budget, time and quality. A key
                      aspect of Arkedge's application development methodology is the early and
                      extensive use of screen mockups or wireframes. In our experience, mockups
                      and wireframes speed up initial approvals, improve the reliability of
                      requirements gathering and documentation, and greatly enhance user
                      acceptance and utilization of the delivered application.

                      In the process, you go through different stages repeatedly while evaluating your designs on each

                      Arkedge is committed to providing high-quality software solutions to its clients. Therefore we

                      developed either by our development team or your existing or new applications. The current
                      techniques and approaches applied to software testing help identify and prevent occurrence of the
                      problems associated with the improper functionality, low reliability, productivity, scalability
                      and other defects of the applications.

                      Our strong belief is to form a QA team in the initial stage of the development phase; this
                      undoubtedly helps reduce the risks of fixing global bugs in later stages. The QA engineers are
                      involved in the development process right off the mark: they are provided with the available
                      documentation, acquainted with the business processes that are to be implemented in the project
                      and technical specifications requested by the client. On the basis of the provided resources our
                      engineers develop a testing plan that meets all the mentioned requirements. It defines the scope
                      of testing and documents the process of quality assurance.
