                                                moving your current data from any legacy system into the new database. A

                                                techniques for migration, based on various factors. Wherever technically
                                                feasible, a direct approach is utilized, using the standard spreadsheet
                                                templates and the up-loader, thereby eliminating the converter process.
                                                The migration methodology consists of phases including Requirements,
                                                Planning, Designing, Deployment, Testing, and Migration.
